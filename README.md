[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/5Qp4_Wqy)

SYNERGY, also known as BookTable, is a comprehensive online restaurant reservation platform designed to enhance the dining experience for customers, restaurant managers, and administrators. It features location-based search, real-time booking capabilities, personalized user profiles, and an integrated review system.

The project was developed collaboratively with a focus on full-stack feature ownership from design to deployment.

#### 🚀 My Contributions to SYNERGY - BookTable:

As a Full Stack Developer on this project, I took ownership of several key features, focusing on both frontend and backend development to ensure a seamless user experience. My specific contributions included:

* **Frontend Engineering & UI Development:**
    * Spearheaded the **UI Project Setup**, including the **Dockerization of the Next.js/React frontend** to streamline development and deployment processes.
    * Engineered and implemented intuitive UI components for **Login and Registration**.
    * Designed and developed the dynamic **Restaurant Search Functionality UI**, integrating robustly with the **Google Maps API** for effective location-based searching and interactive map displays.
    * Created an engaging **Customer Homepage UI**, which included integrating functionality to access the user's nearby location for personalized restaurant suggestions.
    * Developed a user-centric **Customer Profile Page**.
    * Implemented **Restaurant Cards display** for clear and concise presentation of restaurant information.
    * Enabled users to **View Restaurant Locations directly on Google Maps** from within the UI.

* **Backend Development & API Integration:**
    * Led the end-to-end development of the **Restaurant Booking and Cancellation Flow**, covering both the UI (Next.js/React) and backend (Spring Boot) aspects.
    * Developed a **Fetch All Bookings API endpoint** to allow users to retrieve their comprehensive booking history.
    * Enhanced the restaurant fetching API by adding a **Restaurant Booking Count field**, providing valuable insights into booking volumes, displayed on restaurant detail pages and cards.
    * Engineered the **Restaurant Details View (Full Stack)**, encompassing both UI and backend (Spring Boot) development, and integrated a feature to **View Restaurant Location on Google Maps**.

### ⚙️ Log Processing Application (CLI)

This command-line tool is designed to parse log files (`.txt` format) containing diverse log entries. Each line represents a distinct log entry, which the application categorizes and aggregates into structured JSON files, making log data more accessible and analyzable.

It efficiently handles various log types, including:
* **📊 APM (Application Performance Metrics) Logs:** Aggregates metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.
* **🖥️ Application Logs:** Categorizes operational events such as errors, warnings, and info messages.
* **🌐 Request Logs:** Details HTTP requests, response times, and status codes.

The application leverages robust design patterns for extensibility and maintainability:
* **🔗 Chain of Responsibility:** For sequential log processing by type.
* **🎯 Strategy Pattern:** To encapsulate distinct log aggregation logic.

**🛠️ Technologies Used:**

* Java
* Gradle (build system)
* Gson (JSON serialization)

**💡 Key Features & Design:**

* Parses `.txt` log files and categorizes entries.
* Aggregates data into JSON outputs for APM, Application, and Request logs.
* Extensible architecture for future support of more log types and formats.
* Clear command-line interface for building and execution.
