SYNERGY, also known as BookTable, is a comprehensive online restaurant reservation platform designed to enhance the dining experience for customers, restaurant managers, and administrators. It features location-based search, real-time booking capabilities, personalized user profiles, and an integrated review system.

The project was developed collaboratively with a focus on full-stack feature ownership from design to deployment.
